                <h2>Brand Identity and Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    Web Traffic is an original game concept for mobile and browser enjoyment. It is a casual
                    free-to-play
                    endless runner game where users compete for high scores on the leaderboard. The user plays as a car,
                    and
                    the goal is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible. But, Web Traffic has a twist. There are
                    three
                    types of levels: high, medium, and low traffic. In high traffic levels, other cars are the main
                    obstacles. In low traffic levels, the environment is the main obstacle. Before playing a level, the
                    user
                    can input a website URL or select popular sites from a list. Web Traffic selects a level based on
                    how
                    popular the inputted website is. Essentially, the level style is based on the inputted website's
                    popularity, or traffic.
                    <br><br>
                    The target audience for Web Traffic is women who are casual mobile game enjoyers. According to a
                    2017
                    report from Google Play, 64% of women prefer mobile gaming over other platforms, as opposed to only
                    38%
                    of men. Since women encompass over half of the active market, this demographic should be recognized.
                    Furthermore, Web Traffic is easily accessible because it is free-to-play and fast-paced.

                <h2>Visual Design</h2>
                <p>
                    My color palette was inspired by road signage and other colors prominent on the road. I equally
                    wanted
                    to ensure that the color palette was energetic to convey the fast pace of gameplay. Similarly, I
                    chose
                    Variex as a decorative typeface to maintain the energy and create movement in the lettering. I chose
                    Filson soft as the body text to contrast the sharpness of Variex and bring something more
                    contemporary
                    into the design.
                    <br><br>
                    My interactive prototype is a website explaining Web Traffic, featuring the chosen color palette and
                    font pairings. I prioritized strong visual hierarchy and legibility in my final design.
