        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        I'm a second-year UXID student at Drexel University. My background in fine art and coding helps me look at
        interfaces with an understanding of how front-end design and back-end programming work together. My goal, shaped
        by
        my past experiences with leadership and artistic direction, is to lead a team of UX designers. I want to work
        with a
        team of people who constantly learn from each other, and who aren't afraid to fail as part of the process.
        </br></br>
        I'm from Belmar, New Jersey, which is a small beach town with a population of about 5,000 residents. I attended
        Communications High School, a magnet school that focuses on career readiness in the communications field. I
        applied
        with hopes of becoming a graphic designer, but a mandatory beginner-level Python class changed my perspective.
        Initially, I dreaded it, but soon realized that I wanted to learn more about coding. That inspired me to pursue
        UXID, combining graphic design and web development.
        </br></br>
        Later in high school, I became the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine, National Art Honor Society
        president,
        Art Club president, and the art department leader in the drama club. These roles allowed me to experience
        arts-related leadership on a smaller scale. I found that my work is most fulfilling when I collaborate with
        equally
        ambitious people, and I wanted my peers to be proud of the work we did.
        </br></br>
        After transferring to Drexel from Rochester Institute of Technology, I'm glad that I made the choice to attend
        Drexel. I love being in Philadelphia and the proximity to other major cities in the northeast. One of the things
        I'm
        most excited about is co-op, and UXID students are able to complete three separate co-op experiences. While on
        co-op, I hope to learn from my colleagues and practice design in a workplace environment.
