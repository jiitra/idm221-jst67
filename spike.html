                Spike's Underwater Adventure is a mobile game for children ages 4-7. The levels include activities like
                coloring, tapping, and sorting items. The app aims to improve children's motor skills in engaging ways.
                <br><br>
                As the graphic design lead, I designed Spike the Pufferfish and other graphics for the game. I created
                the intro animation using Adobe After Effects with graphics created in Adobe Illustrator. On the
                development side, I coded buttons on pages and linked pages together.
                <br><br>
                I also collaborated with my team to help design a responsive interface using ConstraintLayout. It was
                essential to ensure the functionality of the games across multiple devices.
                <br><br>
                My favorite part of the project was testing the app with students from a local elementary school.
                Students in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade tested the app, with the best results coming
                from students in kindergarten and first grade. During testing, my team was able to assess how
                challenging the levels were for students to complete and how connected they felt to the gameplay.
                <br><br>
                The mascot, Spike, was incredibly popular with the children. They felt more encouraged to play the games
                because they felt connected to Spike and his friends. The games were appropriately challenging for the
                kindergarteners and first graders, and the students enjoyed completing the levels.
